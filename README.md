🌾 TN Agri-Intelligence Hub

An AI-Powered Agriculture Decision Support System for Tamil Nadu

This project is a comprehensive data science and web application solution designed to assist farmers and agricultural policymakers in Tamil Nadu. It leverages historical yield data, real-time weather APIs, and scientific soil profiles to provide actionable insights.

🌟 Features

1. 🌱 Smart Crop Recommender

How it works: Uses a Machine Learning Classifier to analyze soil composition (NPK), pH levels, and expected weather.

Output: Recommends the top 3 most suitable crops for your specific land conditions with confidence scores.

2. 🤖 Yield Predictor

How it works: Uses a Random Forest Regressor trained on historical Tamil Nadu agriculture data enriched with Open-Meteo weather archives.

Live Data: Integrates with OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time temperature for the selected district.

Output: Predicts the expected yield (Tonnes/Hectare) and total production.

3. 🗺️ Geo-Spatial Analysis

How it works: Aggregates historical performance data by district.

Output: An interactive dark-mode map of Tamil Nadu visualizing high and low-yield zones.

4. 🧪 Soil Doctor

How it works: Compares user soil inputs against agronomic standards.

Output: Provides specific fertilizer recommendations (e.g., "Apply Urea for Low Nitrogen", "Treat with Gypsum for Alkalinity") and visualizes soil health on a gauge.

📂 Project Structure

app.py: The main Streamlit web application. Contains the frontend logic, visualizations, and model inference.

cropred.ipynb: The Data Science pipeline. Handles data cleaning, fetching historical weather via API, enriching data with soil profiles, training models, and saving them.

requirements.txt: List of dependencies.

*.pkl: (Generated by notebook) Saved Machine Learning models and label encoders.

🚀 Installation & Usage

Clone the Repository

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/TN-Agri-Hub.git](https://github.com/your-username/TN-Agri-Hub.git)
cd TN-Agri-Hub


Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


Data Preparation (Optional)
If you want to retrain the models or fetch fresh weather data:

Open cropred.ipynb in Jupyter/Colab.

Ensure your CSV dataset is in the correct path.

Run all cells to generate final_model.pkl and crop_yield_final_dataset.csv.

Run the App

streamlit run app.py
